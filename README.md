# Smart Snu Hackathon
### Online real-time survey and monitoring of water bodies in Delhi | Sussy Hackathon GC's submission for the Smart SNU Hackathon

This project creates a REST API that enables real time monitoring of water bodies in Delhi - both by POST requests from sensors at the water bodies, and by GET requests from anyone using the API to access the database. It also establishes a website to present the information collected about water bodies in Delhi.
